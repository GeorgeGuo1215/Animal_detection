**Title: Web-Based Real-Time Vital Signs Monitoring System Using Millimeter-Wave Radar**

A web-based system for real-time physiological monitoring using millimeter-wave radar technology is disclosed. The invention integrates web browser functionality with Bluetooth connectivity to enable remote, non-contact vital signs detection without requiring specialized hardware installation.

The system processes radar data streams to extract heart rate and respiratory rate through advanced signal processing algorithms. Users can upload pre-recorded radar data files or connect directly to Bluetooth-enabled radar devices for live monitoring. The interface provides real-time visualization of physiological waveforms, statistical analysis, and diagnostic reporting.

Key innovations include automatic detection of resting states using inertial measurement unit (IMU) data to ensure accurate baseline physiological measurements, dual-value data recording (raw and smoothed values) for enhanced analysis capabilities, and adaptive filtering algorithms optimized for web browser performance.

The system operates entirely within standard web browsers on any device with Bluetooth support, enabling ubiquitous access to professional-grade physiological monitoring capabilities for telemedicine, sports science, and personal health tracking applications.
